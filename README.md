# Localization of a micro aerial vehicle
This script is an application of the EKF to estimate the state of a tiny drone.

The state of the MAV includes [position, velocity, orientation, gyroscope sensor bias, accelerometer sensor bias]

Three datasets were prepared for the model to be tested on. 

Onboard IMU sensor data being used for prediction and VICON data being used for measurement updates
